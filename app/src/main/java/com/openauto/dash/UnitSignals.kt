/*
 * Small things the QF firmware (ROCO K706) tells every app, read once at the
 * start from its system properties and then followed by broadcast (worked
 * out from the firmware):
 *  - the headlights, for the Auto appearance (lights on: the dark version);
 *  - the phone on the unit's Bluetooth: its name and battery (0..5), for the bar;
 *  - CarPlay / Android Auto (zlink): connected, and on screen or not. While
 *    it's on screen the phone's calls are its business, and Dashwheel's own
 *    alerts keep to the pill;
 *  - the car's outside temperature sensor, as the CAN box reads it (what the
 *    firmware's own status bar shows).
 * Other units say none of this: everything stays at "nothing to show".
