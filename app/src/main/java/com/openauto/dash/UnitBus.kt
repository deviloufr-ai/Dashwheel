 * vehicle bus as the source `unit.bus` (CANBOX). The family's adapter decodes and puts the keys itself
 * ([VehicleBusSource.start]); this object only registers the source, hands the adapter a publisher that
 * counts each put as word from the bus, and drops the source when the bus goes quiet or its feed is lost.
 *
 * On the QF firmware nothing is put here: its car app, MCU and broadcasts are sources of their own
 * (CarBox, McuFeed / McuReader, UnitSignals).
