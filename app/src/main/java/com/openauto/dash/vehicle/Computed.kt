/*
 * Estimates are sources, not a kind of data (docs/vehicle-bus.md): a COMPUTED provider publishes the same key
 * the car would, as Quality.ESTIMATED, and only when nothing better says it.
 *
 *   computed.gear    GEAR            from RPM and VEHICLE_SPEED (and REVERSE), the estimator's table learned on the road
 *   computed.range   RANGE           from FUEL_LEVEL at the usual consumption
 *                    FUEL_LEVEL      from RANGE, when the car gives no level
 *   computed.engine  ENGINE_RUNNING  from RPM
 *
 * Each runs only while its output is wanted and no other source (any that is not COMPUTED) has it, subscribing
 * to its inputs only then, so an adapter polls for them only for a reason. And an estimate never reads another
 * estimate: that is what keeps range and level from feeding each other.
