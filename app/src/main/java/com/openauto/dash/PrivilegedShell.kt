 * ([ShizukuShell]), or the head unit's internal ADB socket ([AdbInstaller]).
 * Found out once at start ([probe]) and again when the launcher comes back to
 * the front while nothing was found ([refresh]), so root granted in Magisk
 * meanwhile is picked up; Shizuku coming or going asks for a new look itself
 * ([recheck]).
 *
 * The features built on one of them (the system-app install, the boot logo,
 * app windows and the Maps window, the volume keys, the CANbox stream) stay
 * out of the settings, the widget catalogue and the templates while neither
 * is there: a phone or an unrooted unit never shows a control that can only
 * fail. Until the probe has answered, nothing is offered either.
 *
 * The Play edition ([Edition.play]) has neither and never looks: the probe
 * answers [Access.NONE] without running `su` or opening a socket.
