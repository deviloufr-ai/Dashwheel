/*
 * The drive log: each drive as the trip computer counted it (distance, time,
 * average and top speed) with the eco-driving card's verdict on it, kept on
 * the head unit and handed to the linked phone, where the companion app shows
 * them.
 *
 * A drive is the trip computer's trip. It ends by itself once the car has
 * stood still for ten minutes, or as soon as the eco-driving card closes its
 * drive because the engine was switched off (OBD), or when the driver resets
 * the trip: it is logged (if it went anywhere) and a fresh trip starts. The
 * trip under way is saved every half minute, so a unit switched off mid-drive
 * carries it on when it comes back within those ten minutes. The drive under
 * way is also reported to the phone as it goes, because the key turned off
 * cuts the link long before the drive is closed.
