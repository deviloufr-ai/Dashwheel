/**
 * Another app, Google Maps, running inside a dashboard tile: it is launched
 * onto a virtual display of the tile's size, whose picture is the tile's
 * [TextureView], and the tile's touches are sent on to it. The same way
 * Android Auto shows Maps on a car's screen.
 *
 * Android lets an app do this only with two permissions it keeps for the
 * firmware's own apps: INTERNAL_SYSTEM_WINDOW to open another app on its
 * display, INJECT_EVENTS to touch it. On the K706 they are granted once
 * PMPatch3 runs in Magisk (it makes every signature check pass), so the tile
 * is only offered where Android has granted the first one ([allowed]).
 *
 * One display per app, kept for as long as a tile shows it: a page swipe
 * only takes the picture away, so a navigation goes on and comes back as it
 * was. The display is closed, and the app with it, once no tile is left
 * ([releaseUnless]).
 *
 * An app runs only once, so several tiles of it (Maps on two pages) share its
 * one display: the picture goes to the tile on screen ([pickTile]).
 *
 * Opening an app on a display puts that display in front, and Android sends
 * the unit's keys (the touch keys beside the screen: Home, Back...) to the
 * display in front: Home then looks for a home screen on the tile's display,
 * finds none and does nothing. So the keys are handed back to the main screen
 * after each launch there, and after each touch ([giveKeysBack]).
