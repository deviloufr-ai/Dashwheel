/*
 * The ignition, as the head unit's firmware announces it to every app
 * ([UnitPlatform.adapter]'s [IgnitionSource]; on the QF firmware of the ROCO
 * K706: ACC on when the key turns, ACC off then "ready to sleep" when it's
 * switched off). With Dashwheel on the unit's sleep whitelist it lives through
 * the off time, so it can act on both ends:
 *  - on: the adapter reconnects at once, and the startup briefing speaks
 *    right then (only after a real stop, see [briefOnIgnition]);
 *  - off: the car's spot is kept as where it's parked (the Parking tile, the
 *    companion's "where's my car"), and the OBD link is closed cleanly and
 *    left closed until the key turns again ([VehicleMonitor]).
 * A unit whose firmware says nothing has no source; the briefing's heartbeat stands in there.
