/*
 * How Dashwheel speaks to one family of head unit firmware. Each facade the
 * rest of the app already uses (CarPower, CarBox, HeadUnitKeys, MediaVolume,
 * UnitLauncher, RomPopups...) asks [UnitPlatform.adapter] for the piece it
 * needs and does nothing when the piece is null: that is how a feature stays
 * out of the way on a unit whose firmware has no such thing.
 *
 * A piece is non-null only when its firmware hook was actually found on the
 * unit (the property set, the package installed, the binder registered), so
 * a wrong family never starts code the unit can't answer.
