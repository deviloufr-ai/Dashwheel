/*
 * The gear the car is in, as the bus has it (K.GEAR). A car source that says it wins; none does yet, so it is
 * the estimate of `computed.gear` ([startGearEstimate]): reverse comes from the
 * head unit's reversing signal (the camera the ROM brings up), and the forward
 * gears from the engine's revs against the road speed, each gear turning the
 * engine a set number of rpm per km/h. The table starts from the car's gearbox
 * (the C4 Picasso's BMP6 figures, else a typical six-speed spread) and settles
 * on the car's own ratios as it drives. Rolling with the engine at idle and no
 * gear matching reads as free-wheeling (neutral or the clutch open). A robotised
 * box's A/M mode is not in any feed Dashwheel reads.
