/**
 * Opens an app alongside the dashboard, preferring the system's real
 * split-screen and falling back to a freeform floating window.
 *
 * **Preferred path — system split via accessibility.** This head unit's ROM
 * ignores AOSP split-screen and blocks `am task resize` ("resizeTask not
 * allowed"), so we can't tile two windows through the windowing APIs. But the
 * ROM *does* support split the manual way — recents → long-press an app → drag
 * to a side — because that goes through SystemUI, not the AOSP APIs. When the
 * [SplitAccessibilityService] is enabled we drive that same SystemUI path with
 * `GLOBAL_ACTION_TOGGLE_SPLIT_SCREEN`: it docks the foreground task (the
 * dashboard), then we fill the other half with [Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT].
 *
 * **Fallback — freeform.** If the service isn't enabled, we launch the app in
 * freeform mode: a movable/resizable floating window (the system picks the
 * position; our bounds are a hint it may ignore).
