 * waits until it is sure (a few frames, a few seconds), stays up long enough
 * to be read, and doesn't nag: a wheel on the line is told once until the car
 * is back in its lane, following too close once in a while.
 *
 * The limits follow what cars' own systems do: the collision warning from
 * 30 km/h at under 2.4 s to impact (closer in town), the lane from 60 km/h
 * and never with an indicator on, following too close under 0.8 s behind
 * from 50 km/h.
