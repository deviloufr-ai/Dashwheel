 * The Topway TS firmware's MCU link, as its car app (com.tw.car 880_0000_260911,
 * a TS10.2.2 unit's copy) uses it: the framework's `android.tw.john.TWUtil`,
 * opened on a list of channels (`open(short[])`, 0 for done), started, and
 * handed a Handler (`addHandler(tag, handler)`). Each message is one channel
 * ([android.os.Message.what]), with [android.os.Message.arg1] and, for the
 * canbox's, its frame's bytes in [android.os.Message.obj].
 *
 * Read from the car app's bytecode, not from Topway: what is not named here
 * is not known. Dashwheel only listens; it never writes to the MCU.
